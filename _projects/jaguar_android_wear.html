				<h2>What we created</h2>
				<p>In this project I overcame many technical challenges including: a shared white label code base (Jaguar and Land Rover), legacy phone app code, networking delays and effective communication between the watch and phone.</p>
				<p>One of the biggest of these challenges that I had to overcome due to the impact it had on the user experience was the networking delays. Due to the way the networking code was handled in the legacy phone app we had to devise a way to keep any new network requirements separate from existing solutions. For this I decided to create a brand new module in the app with the sole purpose of handling network requests and kept all the associated logic away from the views. This would allow for future updates to use the networking features without fear of having an impact on existing views within the app.</p>
