				<h2>What we created</h2>
				<p>The aim of the Passenger ticketing platform was to create simple apps that allowed customers to purchase tickets with ease while reducing boarding times for the buses. Passenger ticketing was created from the begining to be highly configurable and applicable to many bus operators.</p>
				<p>The ticketing app ensures speed of boarding by using a bold, animated, yet simple pin that the drivers can verify at a glance, no more searching paper tickets for a date or secret code to validate a ticket.</p>
				<p>During the creation of this project I setup jenkins server to frequently test the build, distribute the build internally or to clients and finally to release it to the Google Play Store. The Jenkins setup also included setup of automated instrumentation and unit tests as well as Jacoco code coverage, lint and checkstyle reports. An Artifactory server was also leveraged to allow for reusable components such as UI widgets or API modules to be reused on any future project.</p>

						<li>Retrofit</li>
						<li>RxJava</li>
						<li>Google Analytics</li>
